# UART-Transceiver-on-FPGA
Presently FPGAs are coming very strongly in the digital hardware systems as it provides
the opportunity for reconfiguration powered with good clock speed and design resources.
The usage of FPGA systems in real time domain is also a very fruitful proposition as the
FPGA devices are coming with processing cores for Real Time data processing. In a complex system scenario involving a large amount of processing tasks, there is a requirement
of building the system using multiple FPGA devices. To make this possible we have to
establish a real time data communication between the FPGA devices or between the user
and the FPGA.
Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (UART) protocol is a kind of serial
communication protocol mostly used for short-distance, low speed, low-cost data exchange
between computer and its peripherals. This project explores the communication between
FPGA and PC, both wired and wirelessly and also between two or more FPGAs using
the UART protocol.
